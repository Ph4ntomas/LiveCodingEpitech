# Live Coding C++

This repository contains code mostly written during live coding I made for Epitech's Students.

## Session 1
Building a JSON library using "basic" C++, then introducing some concepts.

Change made after the live coding:
  - Renaming some files
  - Renaming some classes
  - Adding methods left unimplemented during the live session.
  - Adding a main
